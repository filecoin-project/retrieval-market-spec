# Roadmap Overview

The roadmap in this document is broken into 3 milestones covering the estimated "first year" of development up to a "V1" milestone, and an unbounded "V2" milestone covering everything after that.

## **V0 Milestone**: Existing Or Finished In 3 Months

The V0 milestone describes simply what exists now, or will exist in 3 months. It contains primarily work that is either done or actively in development. For any new efforts not already started, the primary goal is just to fix extreme problem areas in the Filecoin Retrieval Market *AS IT STANDS*. Large areas of functionality in this specification will be missing or incomplete.

## **V0.5 Milestone**: Six Months

The V0.5 milestone is focused on lowering barriers to access, and making existing functionality work better. There will still be parts missing that make the Retrieval Market incomplete as true content delivery network, but we aim to provide a network that lots of folks can be part of and exchange content and coins easily in.

## **V1 Milestone**: 1 Year

The goal of the V1 1 year-milestone is "MVP for a Web 3 content delivery network". By V1, each major part of the Retrieval market is built, if not built in ideal or feature complete ways. The market should deliver subsecond retrieval times to off chain dapp users, unlocking significant product market fit for this segment

The V1 Milestone is defined as much by what's not in it as what is. Specifically, the V1 Milestone is comprised only of solutions for which there is a clear path to implementation. In other words, nothing that *needs deep research*. This includes:
- Any kind of on chain incentives or other complex cryptoeconomics
- Future content routing solutions (see PL Research 2021 Endeavor)
- Fancy geographic on demand content distribution and content marketplaces (see 3DM docs)

## **V2 Milestone**: Future Directions

With the above areas of research hopefully producing more well defined solutions in a year or so, V2 encompasses everything concrete we'd like to build next. It has no specific timeframe for implementation or delivery.
